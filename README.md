# MC-New-World-PvP
A Minecraft plug-in to manage PvP status, inspired by *New World*.

## Features
The **spawn** and **active beacons** define *Safe Points*, in which PvP is disabled and players can set their PvP status for the outside, much like cities in New World.  
A **30 seconds immunity** is granted to PvP players leaving a *Safe Point* before their PvP turns back on again.  
PvP Players have their name displayed in **red** and have a **Luck I** boost as well as a **x1.5 exp** boost while PvP is active.

The only command featured in this plug-in is `/pvp true|false` to set your PvP status inside *Safe Points*.
